# Alexander Ho -- GitHub Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. My name is Alex, I'm a third year undergraduate student at the University of Alberta, studying Computer Science with a specialization in Software Practice and an minor in Business. Here you can find a number of my projects, experiences, and education.

I am a motivated Computer Science student with solid skills in data systems, serialization, formal systems, object-oriented programming, and game development. I also bring excellent writing, analysis, leadership, and interpersonal skills to my work.

* I’m currently working on a **Survival Prediction Website** for a client at the University of Alberta, using Python, R, and React to create a tool for patient survival prediction models.
* I’m currently expanding my skills in machine learning and computer vision, applying technologies like PyTorch and TensorFlow to projects like my **SignWave** hackathon entry and the **Survival Prediction Website**.
* You can reach me at **alex.ho00001@gmail.com** or connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-ho-448a67293)**.
* Fun fact: I am an **Eagle Scout**!

## 🏆 Projects & Hackathons

### **Survival Prediction Website** (2025)
* Currently working with a client at the University of Alberta to create a website for patient survival prediction models.
* Functionality will allow users to upload patient survival data and use internal machine learning models, such as the Kaplan-Meier Estimator, to predict survival.
* **Tech:** Python, R, Ruby on Rails, C++, and React.
* Currently a private repository, will be published once completed.

### **SignWave (natHACKS MedTech 3rd Place)** (2025)
* Worked on a team during the natHACKS hackathon to deliver a website allowing users to learn sign language.
* Used computer vision and machine learning models to predict words users were trying to sign.
* **Tech:** Python, TypeScript, Firebase, and MediaPipe.
