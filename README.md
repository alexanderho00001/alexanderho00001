# Alexander Ho -- GitHub Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. My name is Alex, I'm a third year undergraduate student at the University of Alberta, studying Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and an minor in Business. Here you can find a number of my projects, experiences, and education.

I am a motivated Computer Science student with solid skills in data systems, serialization, machine learning, formal systems, object-oriented programming, and game development. I also bring excellent writing, analysis, leadership, and interpersonal skills to my work.

* I recently worked with **[Envision Mind Care](https://www.envisionmindcare.com)** to build an Artificial Intelligence "Clinic Brain" to run the clinic's daily operations.
* I’m currently expanding my skills in machine learning and computer vision, applying technologies like PyTorch and TensorFlow to projects like my **SignWave** hackathon entry and the **Survival Prediction Website**.
* You can reach me at **alex.ho00001@gmail.com** or connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-ho-448a67293)**.
* Fun fact: I am an **Eagle Scout**!

## 🏆 Projects & Hackathons

## **Envision Mind Care LUMI** (2026)
* Worked with the Envision Mind Care Software Engineering team to build a "Clinic Brain" capable of running the clinic's everyday activities.
* The AI software organized the clinic's scheduling, calendar, notifications, tasks, and even scribe client-to-patient interactions.

### **Survival Prediction Website** (2025)
* Worked with a team client at the University of Alberta to create a website for patient survival prediction models.
* Functionality allows users to upload patient survival data and use internal machine learning models, such as the Kaplan-Meier Estimator, to predict survival.
* **Tech:** Python (Django backend), TypeScript (NextJS frontend), and React.
